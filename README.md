# RetailTrialImpactAnalysis
I analyze customer/transaction data to identify sales patterns, inconsistencies, and key drivers. Using Python, I define metrics, select control stores, and compare trial stores via stats/visualizations. Findings are structured with the Pyramid Principle, delivering actionable insights and strategic recommendations in a detailed report.
